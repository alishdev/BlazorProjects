Remove all UI elements in MainPage. Split the page to 2 vertical panels. Left panel should be 25% width of the entire screen, the right panel should cover the rest of the screen. Split right panel to 2 horizontal panels. Top panel (RTP) should be 25% of the screen height, the bottom panel (RBP) should cover the rest of the screen. Place 3 elements in RTP panel: label "Type the Question", multiline editbox and a button "Submit". Place one element called lResult in RBP panel with label "Result". In the left panel have several tabs. The first tab must be called Settings. The names of other tabs should come from a List of LLM objects, where LLM is a C# class. When user clicks on a tab, if the tab is an LLM, show the LLM name in the lResult control. If the tab is Settings, hide lResult control and show a list of checkboxes which is generated form a list of LLMs. Initially all checkboxes are enabled. When user unchecks a checkbox with LLM name, then hide corresponding tab. When user enables a checkbox then show the corresponding tab.

few changes required - tabs must be ordered vertically. also the checkbox list must appear in the right panel instead of lResult control when user click on Settings tab

when user clicks on Settings tab hide top panel in the right panel and only leave checkboxes with a label "Select LLMs"
when user clicks on Settings tab the bottom panel in the right panel must expand over entire right panel
