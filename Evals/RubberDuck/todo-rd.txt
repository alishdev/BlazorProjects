PRD:
I want to build a personal assistant in python.
I type things I want to discuss and the assistant helps me to brainstorm ideas and it should remember all previous discusssions.
Help me to write product requirements document that I will give to a software developer to implement. 
The assistant should have two chat interfaces and one prompt area.
I type my question in a prompt area, and the assistant sends the history and my question to two LLMs.
My question should appear in both chat interfaces, and responses from LLMs should appear in corresponding chat windows.
All questions and responses should be stored in a Sqlite database.
Create tables for each LLM and each record should be either my question or response from the LLM.
