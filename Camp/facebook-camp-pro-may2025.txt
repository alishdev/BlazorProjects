Hi friends! I'm revising our emergency protocols, particularly missing camper. How much time elapses in a missing camper situation before you contact law enforcement for assistance? At what point do you contact the camper's family? 
Items specific to our situation: Our camp is in Detroit, so we have local police, security companies, and our own law enforcement who can assist. We're also right along the Detroit River and in a very public area, which adds to the challenge of finding a camper.
